## Expectations
It is expected that you accurately record your time at the end of each day in [Electronic Time Card (ETC)](https://etc.esri.com/). At the end of the pay period (end of day on the 15th and the last day of the month) you should submit your timesheet, ensuring all your hours are correct.

## How to Input Time
Time is entered into ETC using decimals: 0.25 for 15 minutes, 0.5 for 30 minutes, 0.75 for 45 minutes, 1.0 for an hour, etc.

- [ ] Review the  [Esri Time Card (ETC) User guide](https://compass.esri.com/resources/appinfo/content/Documentation/etc%20-%20User%20Guides/ETC%20User%20Guide%2003062018.pptx?web=1)

**Please note that your ETC login may not work for a few days while you get setup in the system.**

## Each month has two pay periods

- 1st to the 15th, deposited on the 25th of the month or the Friday before if it occurs on a weekend.
- 16th to the end of the month, deposited on the 10th of next month or the Friday before if it occurs on a weekend.

**Note:** An easy way to remember to submit timecards is to set up two recurring events in your calendar (15th, and last of month) at 5:00PM.

## Charge Codes

We track overhead work (interviews, training, etc) on a different charge code than actual development work. Below are the most frequently used charge codes. 

|Purpose | Charge Code |
|---------|--------------|
| <!-- Add common WBS charges --> | <!-- WBS number --> |
|Team meetings, office all hands meetings, overhead | `C96187I1000` |
|Vacation|`VACA`|
|Sick Time|`SICK`|
 
## Timecard actions
- [ ] Verify that you can log in to your timecard.
