## Initial Training
If you're new to GIS, it can be helpful to start by developing a general understanding.
- [ ] Explore the website [What is GIS?](https://www.esri.com/en-us/what-is-gis/overview) 

- [ ] **[Getting Started with GIS web course](https://www.esri.com/training/catalog/57630434851d31e02a43ef28/getting-started-with-gis/)**
You can take this "briefer" web-based course now (no additional approvals are needed). Note: it was created a few years ago and may not be current with the latest ArcGIS Online releases.

**To Register:**
Navigate to the class you'd like to attend and click on the blue "Register" button that appears just below the course title and follow the prompts to complete your registration.
