## Common Situations 
The purpose of this page is to provide common scenarios, and to empower you to know the action sequences and items that may need to be prepared, in a given scenario.

Mark this issue as done once you've read it through (there are no action items).

## Request off-site training/conference (non Esri)
Esri believes in your professional development and recognizes that attending industry-relevant external conferences is integral to that. Since external conferences tend to offer more than basic training and are held in entertaining locations, Esri sees your attendance also as a reward.
 
### Team members can attend external conferences (non-Esri) if:
- You have been an Esri employee for at least 9 months.
- You have exhausted all relevant training provided by the Esri HR team.
- You did not attend an external conference a year prior to the one being requested.
- The location of the event is restricted to the Contiguous United States (48 adjoining U.S. states plus Washington, D.C.)
- There are no existing issues with your current performance.

### How to start the request process
Send an email to your team lead requesting approval for attendance with the following information
1. Name of the conference you'd like to attend.
2. A short justification of what you plan to learn during the conference and how it will impact your daily work along with the product(s) it will affect.
3. Date(s) of the event
4. Cost of the event (be sure to include early bird pricing, deadlines, etc).

## Request Esri conference attendance
Esri hosts these major conferences every year in addition to others:
* User Conference - Summer (usually early July)
  * yearly user conference held in San Diego, CA.
* Federal GIS Conference - Winter (usually February)
  * yearly federal user conference geared toward the federal space.
* Developer Summit - Spring (usually early March)
  * yearly user conference geared toward developers

### How to attend
If you have interest in attending you can email your manager and/or admin to get the process started.

## Travel Requests
If the training is off-site and requires travel to attend, then once the training request is approved a [travel request](https://travel.esri.com) will need to be submitted. Once the Esri Travel team prepares your travel itinerary, they will send it to you for review. Review it carefully to ensure it is accurate and request necessary changes.

## Reimbursement for Travel Expenses
Within 1 business day (~24 hours) submit your [travel expense report](https://apps.powerapps.com/play/ed7077d4-23b3-4706-be19-7b0b73b41607?tenantId=aee6e3c9-711e-4c7c-bd27-04f2307db20d&source=portal&screenColor=rgba%280%2c%20176%2c%20240%2c%201%29), if needed, and include original copies of receipts as they should be included with your expense report. Reimbursable items generally include the following:

- Per Diem (daily rate fluctuates by destination)
- Airport Parking
- Taxi/Uber to and from your airport and hotel

Your admin (Emma Rodas or Colleen Perkins) can help you fill out a travel request and complete an expense report because they are awesome.

**Note:** For most Esri business travel, the hotel charge will be on your personal credit card when you check out of your hotel at the end of your trip. Through your travel expense report, Esri will reimburse you for the cost of the hotel room. A cash-advance can be requested at the time of submitting your Travel Request.

## When out of office (OOO) for short time

Send an email or to the team and make sure everybody knows when you'll be available/unavailable. Add a note in the Absent channel of the ArcGIS Online Team in Teams. Optionally, mark your calendar as out of office and set an auto-reply on your outlook mail account.

## Time off / Vacation

To request time off or vacation, fill out a vacation request. Go to the [Time Off tab in ETC](https://etc.esri.com/#/request-time-off) to view your current approved vacation requests or take make new ones.

### Access and schedule vacations:

- [ ] Make sure you can sign into the [timecard system](https://etc.esri.com/) and access the Time Off tab.
- [ ] Request any upcoming vacations you might already have planned (optional)

## Hardware and Software Requests
If requesting either hardware or software, please review the [IST Service Desk Hardware, Software, and Service Requests](https://compass.esri.com/org/ISTDiv/Pages/requests.aspx).

Some requests can be made directly through the [Service Now Portal](https://esri.service-now.com/sp/). Some requests will require management approval. If what you need isn't listed, then please send an e-mail to your team lead with the name of the item requested, a justification, the cost, and a link to item's web page.

**Recommended format:**

- Request: {specifically what you are asking for, as detailed as possible }
- Justification: { add justification; what value could it contribute to Esri? }
- Cost: { add price & URL to the pricing details }

After that, work with your admin, Emma Rodas (Redlands) or Colleen Perkins (PDX) via email to complete the request.
