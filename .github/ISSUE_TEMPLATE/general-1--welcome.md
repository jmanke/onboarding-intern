## Welcome <!-- Name -->!
We are incredibly happy to have you as part of the Dashboards team.

Your onboarding consists of completing sequential GitHub issues contained within [this GitHub "project".](https://devtopia.esri.com/vija5789/onboarding) Remember: don't be afraid to ask questions. The quicker you're up and running, the quicker you can contribute.

1. When you begin working on an issue, move the issue to "In progress".
2. If the issue has a checklist, check off items as you complete them. 
3. When you've completed an issue, move it to the "done" column.
4. Move on to the next onboarding issue.
