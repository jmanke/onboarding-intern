As a member of the ArcGIS Online development team, it's important to take a moment to get oriented. Luckily, ArcGIS Online has a resource called Confluence: https://confluencewikidev.esri.com/display/AGO/

Have a read through of the following ArcGIS Online team pages from the confluence wiki:

- [ ] [Onboarding](https://confluencewikidev.esri.com/display/AGO/Onboarding)
