## Getting Started

In addition to all the other content within this Onboarding Guide, the information below are key things for your first few days that you will want to get setup so you may begin contributing to the team.

## Service Desk 

Service Desk is our internal support team who helps you with your hardware and software configurations. You can open a ticket with Service Desk through the [Service Now Portal](https://esri.service-now.com/sp/), or by emailing servicedesk@esri.com a description of your problem. 

## Setup the Basics
- [ ] Get familiar with [Compass](https://compass.esri.com/). Compass contains lots of resources for Esri employees (things like ergonomics, holiday schedules, etc).
- [ ] Create an e-mail signature for outgoing and reply messages using [Esri's Branding Guideline: E-mail Signatures (pg 43-45)](https://compass.esri.com/org/creativeLab/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=/org/creativeLab/Brand/Esri-Brand-Guidelines.pdf&action=default) (Optional)
- [ ] Submit a business card request using [this request form.](http://arczone.esri.com/forms/) (Optional)

## Setup Your Printers (Optional)
Add the following printers to your computer, based on your office location:
Redlands: TODO
PDX: Add the following printers to your computer. **Note** if these IPs don't work for you, feel free to ask Colleen, she is super duper nice.
- The black and white printer is located behind Colleen: PDX-M1536 - IP: 10.195.27.189
- The color printer is located in the supply room: PDX-M451 - IP: 10.195.27.188

## Get Familiar with OKTA
![screencapture-esri-okta-app-userhome-2018-07-23-18_08_40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6730794/43110955-93a25292-8ea3-11e8-89cd-849c088fec87.png)

Okta is how you authenticate with many services we use at Esri. With Okta, Esri’s IT staff can manage employee's access to any application or device. By visiting Esri’s [OKTA page](https://esri.okta.com) you can see and visit apps assigned to you.  Some of the main things you will access from the OKTA portal are:

- Esri Timecard (how you enter your hours)
- Success Factors (year review/training software)
- Ceridian (for viewing your earnings/tax documents)

And the list goes on based on the privileges that have been granted to you. 

## Get Familiar with the Campus
Use the [Indoor Viewer](https://indoors.esri.com/portal/apps/indoors/index.html?appid=b41fbfeae4954593b40e0327d187b2b3&itemUniqueIdField=PersonNumber&itemSourceKey=People&itemUniqueId=#) to familiarize yourself with the campus, find offices or parking, etc. Use the same credentials you use to access Okta  to sign into the app.
- [ ] Get comfortable using the [Indoor Viewer](https://indoors.esri.com/portal/apps/indoors/index.html?appid=b41fbfeae4954593b40e0327d187b2b3&itemUniqueIdField=PersonNumber&itemSourceKey=People&itemUniqueId=#)

### Two factor Auth

Two factor authentication allows you to use a smart phone to confirm your identity. Setting this up for Okta account is fairly straightforward and involves downloading an app on your phone.

- [ ] Set up two-factor authentication using [this guide](https://compass.esri.com/org/ISTDiv/IST/Processes/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=/org/ISTDiv/IST/Processes/IST%20Processes%20and%20Procedures/Okta%20Verify%20Setup%20(iPhone%20demonstration).docx&action=default)

## Communication & Collaboration

You will mainly use these products to communicate with your team.

- Teams
- GitHub
- Confluence
- Email

During your first few days on the job you should be added to multiple Teams channels and GitHub/Devtopia repos. Accept the invites then get familiar with these interfaces.

## Version Control
**GitHub/Devtopia**
Teams throughout the company use various project management and task-tracking systems. For product development we use "Devtopia" (an enterprise version of GitHub) for assigning tasks (aka "Issues") as well as a code repository. Understand the difference between these environments and when to use both. 
- [ ] Make sure you can access Devtopia: https://devtopia.esri.com
- [ ] Make sure you get added to the [All Esri Members](https://github.com/orgs/Esri/teams/all-esri-members) team on GitHub. If you don't have access, email github_admin@esri.com with your github username and request access (cc your manager). You will need to enable two-factor authentication on the GitHub account you want to be added to the Esri team on GitHub.

## Remote Access

VPN access should have already been requested for you. This will enable you to access Internal Esri resources like payroll, compass, Devtopia, etc when you are not in the office. This is really important if you ever need to work from home or while traveling (anytime you can't be on the "Esri Internal" network).

- [ ] Make sure you can access resources via the VPN:
1. Make sure you have the Pulse Secure application on your machine.
2. Open Pulse secure and click "connect".
  - If you have to add the site first use "Policy Secure (UAC) or Connect Secure (VPN)" as the type and connect.esri.com as the server.
4. You will be asked for your AVWORLD credentials.
5. Authenticate using the two factor auth app you used before.
6. Once complete and connected, browse to something like devtopia.esri.com to test VPN is working.
